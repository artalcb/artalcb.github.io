        <p>Mudkip is a small, amphibious, quadrupedal Pokémon. It has a blue body with a light blue underside. Mudkip
            has a large head with a blue fin on top and a light-blue tail fin. It has black, beady eyes and orange,
            star-shaped gills on its cheeks. Its large tail fin provides powerful acceleration to propel it through the
            water. According to its Pokémon Ranger browser entry, Mudkip is a very docile Pokémon. Mudkip is more
            commonly found in captivity, though it can be found in swamps and other wetlands. In the wild, it sleeps by
            burying itself in the mud soil at the water's edge or bottom of a river. It has been recently seen living in
            the Terarium of Blueberry Academy. </p>

        <p>Swampert is an amphibian-like Pokémon with a bulky frame and four thick limbs, the two longer ones at the
            front serving as arms while the shorter limbs provide support for the creature if it chooses to stand
            upright. Swampert is semi-bipedal. It can stand on its three-toed feet with a hunched posture, and pick up
            or grab objects with its hands, but when moving about it tends to run on all four limbs. It has orange
            conical gills that protrude from round patches on either side of its face. Two large fan-like black fins
            extend from the top of its orange eyes to the back of its head. Similarly, a black fan-like tail fin extends
            upward from its hindquarters. Swampert is predominantly cobalt with a white abdomen, orange gills, and
            similarly orange padding on all four limbs. </p>
