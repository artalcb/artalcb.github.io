        <p> Treecko is a small, green, bipedal reptilian Pokémon. It has yellow eyes with long, narrow pupils. Treecko's
            hands and feet each have three digits covered with tiny spikes. These spikes allow it to scale vertical
            walls with ease. Its stomach and throat are red. It also has a line across its stomach resembling a pouch.
            Treecko has a large, dark green tail with two separate lobes that it uses to sense humidity. This ability
            allows it to predict the next day's weather.</p>

        <p> Grovyle is a bipedal Pokémon similar in appearance to a theropod dinosaur. It is primarily green with a red
            underside. There is a belt-like green stripe across its belly. Grovyle's hands have two clawed fingers and
            powerful legs with birdlike feet. Its well-developed muscles make it an expert climber and allow it to leap
            quickly from branch to branch. Grovyle has three long leaves on its wrists, a large leaf on top of its head,
            and two tails that have a leafy appearance</p>

        <p> Sceptile is a reptilian, bipedal Pokémon. Its neck is somewhat long, and it has two crests on its head. It
            has semicircular, yellow eyes with red rims. Its lower jaw and a belt-like band across its waist are also
            red. Along its back, it has two lines running down the middle and two rows of yellow nodules that are
            described as seeds. Its tail is shaped similar to that of a palm tree's branch. Both of its long arms have
            two sharp, elongated leaves and three claws.</p>
