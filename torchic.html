        <p> Torchic is a small, chick Pokémon with stubby, downy, yellow wings. Its body is covered with orange feathers
            and a fluffy coat of down. There is an orange and yellow crest on its head that resembles a flame. Its two
            thin legs and short beak are a light brownish yellow, and the feet have three toes in front and one in the
            back. A male Torchic will have a small black speck on its rear that is not present in females. Within
            Torchic's belly, this Pokémon has a flame sac filled with a burning fire. This internal flame causes Torchic
            to feel warm if hugged. The warmth feels similar to a warm water bottle. As long as Torchic is alive, the
            internal flame will burn continuously. When attacked, it will shoot fireballs of 1,800 °F (1,000 °C) at its
            foes, leaving them scorched black. </p>

        <p> Combusken is a bipedal, chicken-like Pokémon. Most of Combusken's upper body is yellow, while most of the
            lower body is orange. An orange, pointed design adorns the center of its waist at the dividing line of the
            two colors. It has orange eyes and a short, wide beak. There is a feather crest on top of its head with
            three orange points. This crest is smaller on female Combusken. Its tail is short and pointed. It has three,
            sharp claws at the ends of its long arms, and scaly, gray legs with well-developed thighs covered in shaggy
            feathers. </p>

        <p> Blaziken is a bipedal, chicken-like Pokémon. The majority of Blaziken's body is red with accents of beige,
            yellow, and gray. Behind its head, there are beige, hair-like feathers that continue downward and surround
            its chest and abdomen. It has a small red face with a V-shaped crest on its head. Blaziken's blue eyes are
            semicircular with yellow sclerae, and its mouth is similar to a hooked beak. It has featherless, gray hands
            with three fingers each, and three clawed toes that are not normally visible due to the shaggy, yellow
            feathers on the bottom of its legs. A female has a shorter mask and hair than a male. </p>
